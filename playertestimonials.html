                        website, I was amazed by the incredible builds and how long it had been up.
                        <br><br>
                        And that was just the beginning. At first, I thought the server would be just like simply
                        playing with many random people who treated each other like strangers. On the day I joined along
                        with a few new other mates, we talked to each other a bit but still unsure about this new
                        discovery.
                        <br><br>
                        However, one thing I didn't realize the server often doesn't seem to take enough credit of is
                        their wonderous community. If i had to make a comparison, it would be like being a well-known
                        member on HermitCraft.
                        <br><br>
                        While that was one of the main reasons I decided to stay, there were even more that makes
                        WolfCraft stunning. Players follow the rules and guidelines. I have yet to be griefed and not a
                        day has gone by where I didn't enjoy playing on the server.
                        <br><br>
                        As for someone who isn't a dedicated gamer, I really have to say, WolfCraft is its own unique
                        and wonderful experience. And if you are someone who has been searching around for that perfect
                        server, then I, Vilanti, will be the first one here to welcome you to the WolfCraft family as
                        they all welcomed me~♡

                        Well... its time for a great story... the story of me on wolfcraft s7 and how i reached being
                        the king of sparta... day 1 i started swimming to find a perfect spot to start my adventure.
                        Someone let me stay in his house... i started mining on the nearby area.. i got full iron and
                        then logged off.. when i came back on i died for some reason. After that i tried to find a place
                        to start building my base... i found an unclaimed village where there was a big house on the
                        middle of the village. I left a chest there with my stuff. I started surrounding my village with
                        cobble walls.... someone came on my village to make a breeder i told him that he can use my
                        villagers... but he abandoned his plan and left the villagers free... they died :( ... but this
                        was the start ... the new start... of a new village... i got his idea and started making my own
                        breeder... then a guy... Mewtem... hoped on the server for first time and helped me to build the
                        breeder... then i searched for a name for my village... and here we are SPARTA

                        Season 6 might’ve been the best season for me. I became friends with More_Pepper, and we now
                        play together for 2-6 hours every night. There is almost never a night I’m not in a vc in this
                        server. I might be carrying FuzzyCactus, Ghost, and More_Pepper in bedwars or chilling on
                        Stardew Valley with More_Pepper. I became such good friends, even family, with everyone on the
                        server. I’ll never forget the friends I made on this server for the rest of my life, and I’m
                        looking forwards to what we can do in season 7.

                        So season 6 of wolfcraft....... Where do I even start? This season was quite possibly the best
                        one iv personally had, iv met so many people and made so many friends and I can very easily call
                        this community my second family. This year has been....... Well interesting to say the least and
                        it's been amazing to just come play and talk with everyone and forget about the outside world
                        and its problems. To be quite honast if it wasn't for wolfcraft I would have died of boredom
                        very quickly :smile:. The best part of this season has got to be playing bedwars, wynncraft and
                        tf2 with pepper, white, fuzzy, nador, cap and jack.

                        In review of this last season, season six... how can I describe it?
                        <br><br>
                        For starters, I met one of my closest friends on WolfCraft this season. She was called gracekj,
                        and for some time she was the light of my life, she was my closest friend and we talked about
                        anything; she helped me grow as a person. I enjoyed playing WolfCraft with her... She left, but
                        we still talk from time to time.
                        <br><br>
                        In the way of projects, I remember building two houses: both on the same lake. The first house I
                        built was a small wooden house, just a box, suspended above shallow water. The main room had a
                        bunch of chests and to the left was the workstation room, to the right was a bedroom, and above
                        was a furnace array. That house is gone now; I allowed Exel to blow it up LOL.
                        <br><br>
                        Anyway, after a long time away from WolfCraft, I came back and settled on the same lake I built
                        my house. Called it Lake Nador. I did a fun project, which was damming up and draining the part
                        of the lake I previously lived on. On the east side of the lake stood my new house, and it was
                        beautiful. If you want to check it out on the S6 world download, the coords are (-2310, 270).
                        <br><br>
                        Near the end of the season, my favorite thing was the spawn. I had a newfound affinity for the
                        spawn no one else shared, so I made a scavenger hunt that had people going all around spawn so
                        people could appreciate it!! I also hosted a Christmas event. Staff is very happy to let people
                        host their own events and I love that
                        <br><br>
                        I think the most alluring thing for me joining was a server economy. For a while, I ran a
                        company, the Nador Delivery Company. I remember how much fun I had delivering parcels from base
                        to base!
                        <br><br>
                        I don't recollect how, but at a certain point I knew I was at home in this community.
                        <br><br>
                        Joining WolfCraft is perhaps the best choice I have made in the way of Minecraft. It gave me new
                        friends and community, gave me good times, and helped me when I needed it. I recommend anyone to
                        join!

                        Every single server I have tried to join, be it an SMP, or a regular survival world which i find
                        on discord, it never works out for me. The people lure me in and actually bully me when I join.
                        You might not know this, but this server was my last try, I said to myself "If this server is
                        toxic like the others, just leave it. Stop hurting yourself." So I applied for the server and I
                        made it! It has been 5 days now, and all i have to say that this server is even better than the
                        Dream SMP or HermitCraft! Everyone here is so kind and welcoming. Most importantly, the chat is
                        not dead! If I am not playin, I just chill and talk with everyone. So all I wanted to say is,
                        thank you WolfCraft, and I hope to have a great time in Season7!

                        Wow, can't believe it's been a year now. This server has been a huge part of my life and helped
                        me go though the toughest periods of my life, these people have helped me immensely and I don't
                        know where would I be if not for them. For the year I've been here I've seen some wonderful
                        people come and go, from perspective of both of a normal player as well as from a high rank
                        staff member and I had a whole bunch of experiences, good and bad, laugh-inducing and
                        heart-breaking, awesome collaborations and minor annoyances, rises and falls. For all of those
                        wonderful experiences I'd like to thank everyone who plays, have played or will play on this
                        server and be a part of this community as well as our wonderful staff team, current as well as
                        those who are no longer with us, for keeping this thing going, as well as emphasise the part of
                        owner and initiator of this whole endeavour - Flashfrost - he made this whole thing happen as
                        well as sustained this community and the server it's centred around despite the struggles it
                        went through
                        <br><br>
                        I'm not very good at writing long essays as some of our members but I've done my best, thank you
                        for all the good time I had in here, and hope it keeps going for years to come :hearts:

                        Ladies and Gentlemen i present you this story as a parting gift
                        <br><br>
                        This is the story of an old man - as told by scribble_goat
                        <br><br>
                        An old man lived in a village. He was one of the most unfortunate people in the world. The whole
                        village was tired of him; he was always gloomy, he constantly complained and was always in a bad
                        mood.
                        The longer he lived, the more bile he was becoming and the more poisonous were his words. People
                        avoided him, because his misfortune became contagious. It was even unnatural and insulting to be
                        happy next to him
                        He created the feeling of unhappiness in others
                        But one day, when he turned eighty years old an incredible thing happened. Instantly everyone
                        started hearing the rumour:"an old man is happy today,he doesnt complain about anything, smiles,
                        and even his face freshened up".
                        the whole village gathered together. The old man was asked:
                        <br><br>
                        Villager: "what happened to you?"
                        <br><br>
                        "nothing special. Eighty years I've been chasing happiness, and it was useless. And now i have
                        decided to live without happiness and just enjoy life. That's why im happy now." - An old man

                        online and give me my gear, so i was like "whatever i'm grabbing the best possible gear from our
                        chests and heading over". Unfortunately, all i found was some half-durability iron armour,
                        golden boots, a sharpness IV golden sword and a shield. I rushed to the nether and in the
                        attempt to find the way up to the hub i got hopelessly lost. I msged epic to tp me to him
                        because i assumed he wasn't in the end yet, but when he teleported me i found myself on a small
                        platform with creeper, aeris, karateking and epic. I asked them if i can join them in their hunt
                        for the wings and they agreed to take me with them. After several attempts we finally managed to
                        get our ship going and slowly but surely we started moving towards the end islands. The whole
                        flight took us about 10-15 mins and it was scary but fun. Arriving in the end we bumped into
                        some tall chorus flowers which broke our flying machine and forced us to jump off. We dug out a
                        small room to hide from the endermen and get our stuff out of the enderchests. It was at this
                        point that i joined their call btw. We were about to start looking for a city as we noticed that
                        aeris was missing. Note: He had all of our ship parts. Luckily we were able to find him pretty
                        quickly. We kept on moving for a little while until we reached another big void gap. We decided
                        that it was a great idea to start our ship from here. We pillared to about y=114 (i used
                        furnaces because why not), made a platform, and waited for aeris to reconstruct the flying
                        machine. When everyone was aboard karateking updated the observer. This is when things went
                        terribly wrong. Epic somehow managed to punch creeper out of his minecart and he fell into the
                        void. Than i somehow fell out of the flying machine but managed to break my fall using a water
                        bucket. The flying machine kept going and it seemed like i had to chance to catch up with it.
                        The people left in the flying machine stopped it as soon as they reached another end island. At
                        this point i was about 500 blocks away from it and all there was between me and our ship was
                        void. I started bridging over but halfway in i ran out of blocks. Luckily aeris saw me and
                        started bridging towards me (i'd like to mention that before they attemptend to save me they
                        tried to shoot me with a bow as a joke). We climbed up to the flying machine and started
                        thinking about what to do and after a short discussion we decided to keep moving. Unfortunately
                        creeper couldn't return because he was too far away from us and we had to continue without him.
                        After about 15 mins we finally found an endcity! Our excitement was immeasurable.. Maybe we got
                        a little too excited... Right before we stopped our ship epic fell out and died. It was only
                        aeris, karateking and me left. We 3 rushed to the city, only to find that there wasnt a ship
                        there. However we still killed all the shulkers in there and splitted our shulker shells. Now
                        all that was left to do was wait for epic to come back. After about 20 mins epic actually
                        managed to return and we we're able to resume our journey. We flew for maybe 30 mins without
                        finding any end cities or anything. It got even worse when epic fell out a 2nd time because of a
                        glitch. Everyone aboard got more and more tired. We decided to stop our ship, put all of our
                        items into an enderchest and jump off into the void to get back to spawn... Even though we
                        didn't find any elytra and our mission resulted in us dying in the void, we still had a ton of
                        fun together and that's what matters 😄

                        To be honest, my experience on the server has been a very unique one in many ways. However,
                        rather than jumping straight in , lets rewind the clock back to about 3 - 4 months. By this
                        time, I had played on about 2 servers ever since I made a come back into the game. However the
                        one thing both of these had in common where really large player group, the lack of a vanilla
                        gameplay experience, and well pay to win elements. As a enthusiast of redstone, I wanted to
                        learn how to build massive farms that could automate everything I could ever need on the server.
                        It has always been my single goal in any survival world to build every single farm possible.
                        However neither of these servers really allowed that as they either had restrictions on
                        automated farms or changed the redstone behaviour all together to the point you could not even
                        call it redstone. After months of playing with these limitations, I had begun to really not
                        enjoy redstone as many of the amazing builds that where possible were simple thrown out of the
                        window unless heavily modified (Which I didn't have the time nor the knowledge to do).
                        <br><br>
                        The one good thing that did come of these servers were the friends I made. Ghostfaceiscool,
                        CoolRosalie are all people I played with back then and it is because of Ghost, I was able to
                        find WolfCraft and at the end of my first day on the server, I knew I had found an amazing
                        server. As a fan of the Hermitcraft Series, this server was something of a dream find - A pure
                        vanilla experience, friendly folks, and most importantly, no redstone limitations. However, what
                        followed would be considered a very stressful period for me.
                        <br><br>
                        On the pervious server, me Ghost, Rosalie and a couple others formed a group we called the
                        Architects - a fun group that would focus on automation and just enjoying the game. Me and Ghost
                        looked to continue this group on this server and with the start of the War event, our 2 person
                        group became a 8 - 9 person group over night. At first I was happy with the idea of having a
                        large group because I would get to know more people and work on larger builds. While our focus
                        was mostly on the War event, we still tried to have a few builds happening here and there but
                        the one thing that differentiated this group from the small group I had before was that I simply
                        didn't know anyone. Ghost who at the time had been on the server longer than me and had made
                        friends with most of the folks however I barely even got to know em. In fact, it wasn't till a
                        day or two after that I knew we had 8 people in the group and not a couple days after day till I
                        got to meet most of em in person. Furthermore, while I tried to get to know everyone, I never
                        really connected. The fun enjoyable group had turned into a big group where I really ever got to
                        know 2 people - Ghost and Whitelight. Even during projects, there would be so little
                        communication that I wouldn't know what someone was up to and they what I was doing. It got to a
                        point where I really began to feel alone. Around this time, was when I finally shared my
                        feelings with Ghost and we collectively decided to break the Architects to a maximum of 4
                        people: Myself, Ghost, White, and Jack. While we made sure that we kept good ties with the other
                        folks, we wanted the group to be smaller so we could get the feel of a collective group. This is
                        where the Architects truly took shape forming the base for the inclusion of Rosalie a week later
                        and More_Pepper in Season 6.
                        <br><br>
                        Fast forward a few weeks and we are pretty much into season 6. By this time, I am living my
                        minecraft dream - I was playing on an amazing community centred server, I had made some amazing
                        friends to play with, and I was doing redstone freely away from any limitations. Things really
                        couldn't get any better you would think right? Well this is when I found out about the WolfCraft
                        Website - notably that a rework was in progress. As a person who had learnt HTML, CSS and
                        Bootstrap 4 (All Web Development Languages) I decided to lend a hand. Flash (The man behind
                        WolfCraft and now a good friend) to my surprise game me the opportunity to help make the
                        website. He and the staff put a lot of trust in me which I doubt I will ever be able to repay.
                        Even on the server, the trust I put in my friends and the trust they put on me is one of if not
                        the most valuable things to me.
                        <br><br>
                        So what was the point of everything I said above? Well for me at-least most important thing for
                        me is that a server can be a place to just come on where you are forced to protect your builds
                        from the fear of other or it can be a place where you come on, interact with a community that is
                        always welcoming and friendly and walk away at the end of each day with memorable experiences
                        and always something new to look forwards to the next day - and WolfCraft can most definitely be
                        described as the latter one 🙂.

                        Hi my name is SpiniestSum154 or Mr.Monopolyman, I came to this server looking for a loving
                        community and Minecraft lovers, this was a great community to me because everytime I log into
                        Minecraft, on the server people would say “Welcome back!” Or “Hello” and that sparked me up
                        everyday, this server gives me a great thing, which is letting the stress go away. The owner is
                        amazing and all the staff are too! They get me through day which I can’t. Thanks to this server
                        and it’s wonderful people.
                    </p>

                        I joined this server just over 5 months ago now, looking for a nice smp, hermitcraft-like
                        experience. i first started playing minecraft on my ps3 in the early days (cant remember when
                        idk) and i loved playing survival and exploring this never before seen atmosphere in the form of
                        a game. about a year and a half ago my friend showed me a redstone video from mumbo and i liked
                        mumbo's content, eventually after a about a month or so of watching mumbo all of mumbo's
                        redstone videos, i found mumbo's hermitcraft series, and after that i have been wanting to play
                        on an smp server. i think i tried out 4 or 5 different servers before finding wolfcraft. After i
                        joined this server it was pretty close to the end of the server so i didnt play much (in season
                        4) when i got a notification about a new season. i got excited and start playing again. in that
                        season i met so many more friends, like phoenix, swastik, benjy and more. great community, great
                        people. :slight_smile: overall this server has been a stunning experience for me, and i hope to
                        do the best for it as a watchwolf.

                        I’ve joined this server in around the middle of season 4, many of you will think like how but I
                        was called Sacul16 then.

                        When I logged on for the first time I saw great builds and shops and thought: This community

                        <br><br>
                        Before I even left the sd to go start Epic flew by and gave me a shulker with great loot just
                        for free. I also knew that we had player TPing enabled. It is good to have it removed now to

                        Hi, for those of you who don’t know me, I’m a casual minecraft player that like redstones and
                        farms. I’ve only been to the server for a week, but I really like it! Most staff members are
                        nice and reasonable, and rules are obeyed by everyone. Players are nice and happy to help.
                        Occasionally noobs does get in, but that’s very rare, people have a somewhat average to high
                        skill level, and everyone is very creative.
                        <br><br>
                        Since I joined, most players were friendly and included me really fast, they offered help, but I
                        did most stuff myself. For a new player, grinding for gear is rather straight forward. Mine for
                        diamonds, buy fortune, mine more diamonds, call someone boss, make farms.
                        <br><br>
                        I have big plans on the server, I plan to make a item soarter that can soart everything in
                        minecraft, (which is easier said then done btw), something I never done before.
                        <br><br>
                        I would say this is the best vanilla survival server I’ve seen, to those who are new, welcome to
                        WolfCraft!

                        This server helped significantly to pull me out of my depression when quarantine kicked off.
                        Just before joining I had been diagnosed with depression after a mysterious disease had left me
                        exhausted for months on end. It helped me connect with people who I consider great friends to
                        this day and people who helped me get through my issues in a healthy and safe way.

                        I cant write big paragraphs but i love this community, its my favorite community, and i love
                        this so much i am actually scared if I accidentally leave the server. Which is the reason i dont
                        leave the discord even if i am not playing, because the community i know is more than only mc,
                        its on discord too, and i can interact with in game peeps too! I hope we can always stay
                        together.
